# AltEra
## Simulate the Unseen.

**AltEra** is an AI-powered alternate history simulator where users change one specific historical incident and watch a new timeline unfold. The app is built around the butterfly effect: one small change in the past can reshape politics, technology, borders, culture, and the modern world.

Users begin with a predefined historical timeline such as **World War I** or **World War II**, select one real incident, enter a single-sentence "What if?" change, and receive an AI-generated alternate timeline with ripple effects, branching decisions, global consequences, and visual relics from the new reality.

## Core Idea

Instead of asking users to start from a blank page, TimeLens provides curated historical timelines with real incidents, short context briefings, related images, and actual outcomes.

Example:

```txt
Timeline: World War I
Incident: Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, 1914
What if: The assassin hesitates and the motorcade escapes Sarajevo.
```

The AI then generates a structured alternate timeline:

- **Chaos Score**: how disruptive the change is.
- **Immediate Ripple**: consequences within 1 to 5 years.
- **Generational Shift**: consequences within 20 to 50 years.
- **Branching Choices**: three possible social or political reactions.
- **Global Consequence**: the 100+ year outcome after the user chooses a branch.
- **Lost to History**: things that disappear from the original timeline.
- **Gained by Humanity**: new inventions, nations, ideologies, or events created by the divergence.
- **Relic Image Prompt**: a prompt for generating an alternate-history artifact or visual.

## Main Features

### 1. Historical Timeline Selection

Users select one predefined historical timeline, such as:

- World War I Timeline
- World War II Timeline
- Roman Empire Timeline
- Industrial Revolution Timeline
- Cold War Timeline

Each timeline contains real historical incidents with:

- Title
- Year or date
- Location
- Short description
- Related image
- Real historical outcome
- Context briefing

### 2. Context Briefing

Before changing history, the app explains the real event and its stakes. This helps the user understand why the incident mattered and what consequences followed in real history.

### 3. "What If?" Input

The user enters one short sentence describing the change.

Example:

```txt
The courier carrying the battle orders gets lost in the fog.
```

The input should be limited to one sentence to keep the AI focused and prevent overly complex prompts.

### 4. AI Timeline Generation

The AI returns strict structured JSON so the frontend can render the result as a polished timeline.

The first generation includes:

- Chaos Score
- Immediate Ripple
- Generational Shift
- Three branching choices

### 5. Branching Decision

After the generational shift, the app pauses and lets the user choose one of three possible directions. This turns the experience from a simple generator into an interactive simulation.

### 6. Final Consequence Generation

After the branch is selected, the AI generates:

- Global Consequence
- Lost to History
- Gained by Humanity
- Relic image prompt

### 7. Relic Image Generation

The app generates or displays an alternate-history relic image based on the AI prompt.

Examples:

- A museum photograph of a fictional treaty medal
- A military uniform from an empire that never existed
- A newspaper front page from an alternate 1940s
- A schematic of alternate military technology
- A portrait of a leader from the divergent timeline

### 8. Global Multiverse Dashboard

Published simulations appear on a live global dashboard. Other users can view public timelines and explore alternate realities created by the community.

### 9. Publish, Download, Export, and Remix

Users can publish their generated timelines. Other users can:

- View public timelines
- Download or export timelines
- Remix a timeline
- Change a different incident
- Create a new branch from someone else's simulation

## Suggested Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js + TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Animations | Framer Motion |
| Realtime database | Convex |
| AI text generation | OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, or Mistral |
| Structured AI output | JSON schema / structured outputs |
| Image generation | OpenAI image generation or another image model |
| Deployment | Vercel |

## Recommended AI Architecture

TimeLens should not rely only on an LLM's memory. A better design is:

```txt
User selects timeline incident
        ↓
Retrieve real historical context from database
        ↓
Send context + user What If prompt to LLM
        ↓
LLM returns strict JSON
        ↓
Frontend renders timeline, chaos score, branches, and ledger
        ↓
User chooses a branch
        ↓
LLM generates global consequence and relic prompt
        ↓
Image model generates or displays relic image
```

This keeps the output more grounded and reduces historical hallucinations.

## MVP Development Plan

### Tier 1: Core MVP

- Predefined timeline selection
- Incident selection
- Context briefing
- One-sentence What If input
- AI-generated timeline JSON
- Timeline viewer

### Tier 2: Engagement Layer

- Chaos Score meter
- Lost to History vs Gained by Humanity ledger
- Branching decision choices
- Save simulation to Convex

### Tier 3: Wow Features

- Relic image generation
- Global realtime dashboard
- Publish and remix timelines
- Demo mode with a pre-seeded golden path
- Cinematic Framer Motion timeline animations

## Demo Safety Net

Live AI calls can fail, lag, or become expensive during presentations. TimeLens should include a **Demo Mode** with one pre-saved polished simulation.

Example demo:

```txt
Timeline: World War I
Incident: Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
What if: The assassin hesitates and the motorcade escapes Sarajevo.
```

This lets the team demonstrate the full UI, animations, chaos score, branching, ledger, and relic image even if the network or AI API fails.

## Future Enhancements

- AI video generation for cinematic timeline moments
- Interactive alternate world map
- Location-based historical mode using phone camera input
- Classroom mode for teachers and students
- Public voting on best alternate timelines
- Timeline PDF export with generated images
- Multilingual historical simulations

## Project Vision

AltEra turns history into an interactive simulation. It helps users understand that history is not just a list of events, but a chain of causes and consequences. By combining real historical context, AI-generated alternate timelines, branching decisions, and visual relics, the app makes the question **"What if?"** feel alive.

## Development

```bash
npm run install:all
npx convex dev        # terminal 1 (repo root — writes .env.local)
npm run dev           # terminal 2 — syncs env + http://localhost:3000
```

## Project layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `convex/` | Convex backend (database, auth, AI actions) |
| `frontend/` | Next.js app (`app/`, `components/`, `public/`) |
| `.env.local` | Repo root — created by `npx convex dev` |
| `frontend/.env.local` | Auto-synced copy for Next.js (`npm run sync-env`) |

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` at the **repo root**. After `npx convex dev` updates env vars, run `npm run sync-env` (or use `npm run dev`, which syncs automatically). Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the Convex dashboard for AI actions.
